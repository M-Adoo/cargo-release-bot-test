# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Please keep one empty line before and after all headers. (This is required for `git` to produce a conflict when a release is made while a PR is open and the PR's changelog entry would go into the wrong section).

There are 5 types of changes:

- `Features` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Documented` for any changes to the documentation.
- `Breaking` for the detail of any backwards incompatible changes.

And please only add new entries below the `Unreleased` header with the following format:
